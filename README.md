# Bloons TD 6 Automation Script

A Python script I wrote to help me automate grinding collection events in Bloons
TD 6.

You will probably need to meet the following if you want the script to work:

- Have all monkeys unlocked and at least their tier 4 upgrades.
- Have the screen size set to 1600 x 900.
- Have Benjammin DJ Skin.
- Have all monkey knowledge and enabled.
- Be a high level If you want to keep it running overnight undisturbed. I did
  not add a check for level up screens.
- Have Dark Castle map unlocked.

Most types of monkeys are placed to also help you grind for XP. A few aren't
placed because I already have a lot of XP for them.

That is all. I can't provide any further help as this is a personal project.
Feel free to modify the script for your own purposes.

### Why not use hotkeys instead of mouse clicking?

Hotkeys used to work at some point, but Ninja Kiwi might have added some sort of
patch to disable automated key presses. Luckily, mouse clicking still works.

### Will this work on my mobile device?

No.
