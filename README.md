A Python script I wrote to help me grind collection events in Bloons TD 6.

### Requirements

Stuff you need unlocked:

- Disable your monkey knowledge
- x-2-4 Dart Monkey
- x-2-3 Bomb Shooter
- 4-1-x Glue Gunner
- Have Sauda unlocked
- Have Dark Castle unlocked
- Set screen size to `1600 x 900` and turn off fullscreen
  - Reset position by turning on and off fullscreen if you need to

> [!note]
> Make sure your level is high because I did not add level checks.

For the project:

- Install Python if you do not have it: https://www.python.org/
  - I used version `3.12.2` but the latest version will probably work
- Download the source code, and then extract it
  - Click the green button that says "Code"
  - Click `Download ZIP`
- Open cmd/powershell/terminal at the root of the project
  - Press shift+right-click -> `Open command window here` or whatever is most
    similar
- Type `py -m pip install -r requirements.txt` into the terminal and then press
  enter
- Go to the Bloons TD 6 window and then go to the home menu
- Go back to your terminal, and type `py main.py`
  - Press `ctrl+c` to exit whenever if needed

Please do not hesitate to
[make an issue](https://github.com/apacheli/bloons-automation/issues) if you
encounter any difficulties while setting this script up!
