# Bloons TD 6 Automation Script

> [!note]
> This script is working as of `2024-02-12` on version `41.1.7608`.

A Python script I wrote to help me grind collection events in Bloons TD 6. It is
best to leave it running overnight or when you are at college (or school if you
are a baby).

### Requirements

Stuff you need unlocked:

- x-2-4 Dart Monkey
- x-2-3 Bomb Shooter
- 4-1-x Glue Gunner
- Have Sauda unlocked
- Have Dark Castle unlocked
- Set screen size to `1600 x 900` and turn off fullscreen
  - Reset position by turning on and off fullscreen if you need to

> [!note]
> Make sure your level is high because I did not add level checks.

For the project:

- Install Python if you do not have it -> https://www.python.org/
  - I used version `3.12.2` but latest will probably work
- Download and then extract it somewhere
  - Click `<> Code v` the green button on GitHub
  - Click `Download ZIP`
- Open cmd/powershell/terminal at project root
  - Press shift+right-click -> `Open command window here` or whatever is most
    similar on Windows
- Type `py -m pip install requirements.txt`
- Go to Bloons TD 6 window, and go to home menu
- Go back to your terminal, and type `py main.py`
  - Press `ctrl+c` to exit
